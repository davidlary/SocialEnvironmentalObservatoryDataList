# Paid & Restricted Data Sources

## Separated from Open Data

This directory is reserved for documentation of commercial and restricted-use datasets that require purchase or data use agreements.

## Examples of Paid/Restricted Data:

### Commercial Datasets
- **AHA Annual Survey of Hospitals** (1946-2023)
  - Cost: $3,000+/year
  - 500+ variables per hospital
  - Most comprehensive hospital data available
  - Currently mentioned in: 19_ECONOMIC_INDICATORS/ECONOMIC_FINANCE_HEALTH_FACILITIES_COMPREHENSIVE.md

- **CoreLogic Land Ownership**
  - Property ownership, parcel boundaries
  - Commercial real estate data

- **Regrid Parcel Database**
  - Property boundaries and characteristics

### Restricted-Use Files (Require Data Use Agreement)
- **NCHS Restricted Mortality Files**
  - Geographic detail beyond public-use files
  - Subcounty mortality data

- **Census Bureau Protected Microdata**
  - American Community Survey detailed microdata
  - Current Population Survey
  - Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP)

- **NHANES Restricted Geocodes**
  - County-level identifiers for NHANES participants

## Why Separated?

The main repository (directories 00-24) documents **only freely available open data** to:
1. Maintain "open data" purity
2. Enable immediate research without budget constraints
3. Facilitate reproducible science
4. Support global research community

## Future Documentation

Future files in this directory may include:
- COMMERCIAL_DATASETS.md (detailed documentation of paid sources)
- RESTRICTED_USE_FILES.md (how to apply for access)
- PROPRIETARY_HEALTH_DATA.md (commercial insurance claims, EHR data)

## Note

Most research questions can be answered with free open data in directories 00-24. Paid/restricted data is often only needed for specific niche applications or enhanced spatial resolution.
