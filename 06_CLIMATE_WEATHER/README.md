# Climate & Weather Data Sources

## Where to Find Climate/Weather Variables

Climate and weather data is currently documented in:

### **23_INTERNATIONAL_SOURCES/**
- **INTERNATIONAL_CLIMATE_ATMOSPHERIC_SOURCES.md** ⭐ PRIMARY FILE
  - ERA5 (240 variables, 1940-present, hourly, 31km)
  - PRISM (4km precipitation, 1981+)
  - Daymet (1km temperature, 1980+)
  - GRIDMET (4km wind/ET, 1979+)
  - NCEI climate normals and station data (1895+)

### **03_LAND_SOIL_GEOLOGY/**
- **NLCD_NOAA_STORMS_COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md**
  - NOAA Storm Events (48 event types, 1950+)
  - Extreme weather events
  - Tornadoes, hail, flooding, hurricanes

### **07_BUILT_ENVIRONMENT/**
- **NOISE_LIGHT_TEMPERATURE_COMPREHENSIVE.md**
  - Heat exposure (CDC/NOAA HeatRisk, UHI campaigns)
  - Cold exposure
  - Temperature extremes
  - Heating/cooling degree days

### Future Expansion
This directory is reserved for additional climate/weather files if needed:
- DROUGHT_INDICES.md (Palmer, SPEI, SPI)
- CLIMATE_PROJECTIONS.md (LOCA downscaled scenarios)
- PRECIPITATION_EXTREMES.md
