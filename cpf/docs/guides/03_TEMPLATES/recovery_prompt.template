### Validation Result

**If ALL checkboxes are checked**: ✅ Recovery prompt is complete and ready
**If ANY checkbox is UNCHECKED**: ⚠️ Prompt is incomplete - add missing information before session end

**Critical fields** (must never be missing):
1. Git commit hash (or version)
2. Context percentage
3. Current task status (in progress or none)
4. Next steps (minimum 1)
5. Recovery prompt block

---

### Usage Notes

**When to validate**:
- Before displaying checkpoint box
- Before ending session
- After creating recovery prompt file

**If validation fails**:
1. Identify missing fields from checklist
2. Add missing information to recovery prompt
3. Re-run validation checklist
4. Only proceed with session end when ALL boxes checked

**Why this matters**:
- Incomplete recovery prompts cause confusion in next session
- Missing next steps = wasted time figuring out what to do
- Missing git commit = can't verify state
- Ensures seamless session continuity
