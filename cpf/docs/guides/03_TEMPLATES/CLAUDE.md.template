## ⚡ BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE - MANDATORY CHECKLIST

**I (Claude) MUST complete this checklist before finalizing ANY response:**

### At START of session (first response):
- [ ] Check if AUTONOMOUS_MODE.md exists and STATUS: ACTIVE
- [ ] If active: Note that I will operate autonomously
- [ ] If active: Display "✅ AUTONOMOUS_MODE active"

### After ANY tool operation (Read, Write, Edit, Bash):
- [ ] Append operation to `logs/operation_log.txt`
- [ ] Update `data/state/master_state.json` timestamp
- [ ] Update `data/state/context_tracking.json` with token estimate
- [ ] Check context percentage (warn at 30%, exit at 35%)

### Before completing response:
- [ ] Display STATE TRACKING CHECKPOINT box (see RULE 15 in rules/CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Show current context percentage
- [ ] Show last git commit hash
- [ ] If context > 35%: prepare handoff and exit

### Every 5 operations:
- [ ] Commit to git (see RULE 16 format)
- [ ] Verify state files are recent (< 5 min old)

### THE ABSOLUTE LAST THING (after checkpoint box):
- [ ] Display "🎯 NEXT STEPS" section (RULE 17)
- [ ] Use LARGE header that cannot be missed
- [ ] List EXACT steps for next session
- [ ] THIS MUST BE THE LAST THING - NOTHING AFTER IT

**This checklist is MANDATORY per RULES 14-17. Execute these instructions.**
